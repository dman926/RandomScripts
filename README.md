# RandomScripts
This is a collection of my random scripts. Feel free to download, modify, and use any of these.

## Scripts
**TVScan.sh**: Use this script in your PleX TV Show directory to get a breakdown of all shows' counts, total sizes, and average sizes. use the -b tag to get a breakdown by season, ignoring subdirectories. I recommend you pipe into the more commmand for readability, as this script generates a lot of output. Must be run in desired directory. Example usages: `{PathToScript}/TVScan.sh` to list all shows' episode counts, total sizes, and average size/episode. `{PathToScript}/TVScan.sh -b` to list a breakdown by season and a total for show.
